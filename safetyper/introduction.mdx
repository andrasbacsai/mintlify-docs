## Who is it for?

The MVP version (1.0) is using OpenAI's GPT models to check grammar errors.

They have a clear docs on how are they [using your data](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance) (tldr: they don't if you use their API, and safeTyper is using their API), and you can simple [request to delete your data](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6378407-how-can-i-delete-my-account) anytime.

### Roadmap

- Add other LLM (Large Language Models) options. Open-source / self-hostable preferred.
- After a certain point (tbd), open-source SafeTyper
