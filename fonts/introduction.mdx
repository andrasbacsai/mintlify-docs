[Fonts](https://fonts.coollabs.io) is a privacy-friendly drop-in replacement for Google Fonts.

You can use it for free to add fonts to your site. It will be free forever.

## Who is it for?
Everyone with privacy issues with Google Fonts does not want their users to be used as data while surfing your websites/applications.

## Why does it exists?
To have a choice for a privacy-focused but still developer-friendly font library.

## Why is it free?
I'm using [BunnyCDN](https://bunny.net/) to serve all the fonts close to your users, and it costs me around $1/month, so technically, for me, it's not free.

## How is it privacy focused?
- All the application code is open-sourced.
- BunnyCDN has an option to disable logging altogether.
- Hosted on a bare metal server, not on a cloud provider.
