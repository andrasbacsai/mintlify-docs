All of our projects are backed by community over [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/coollabsio) and [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/coollabsio).

## No Venture Capital?

Yes. We are not backed by any VC, because we would like to be a bootstrapped business. 

The truth is, we already said no to 30+ inquiries, because we believe we can achieve our dreams without it.

## How to be financially sustainable?
All of our projects will be open-source & self-hostable, no matter what. But to be financially sustainable:

- We have some products that will have a hosted, but paid version.
