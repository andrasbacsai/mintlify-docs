## Manually

1. Need to set the required environment variables in a `.env` file (see
   [below](./installation.md#environment-variables))
2. Need to have [Docker Engine v20.10+](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
   installed on your server.

### Environment Variables

Coolify needs to have the following environment variables to be set in advance.

> This is done automatically with the automated installation script.

COOLIFY_SECRET_KEY=
COOLIFY_DATABASE_URL=file:../db/prod.db

## Change Configuration

You can always execute the installation script with different options to
reconfigure Coolify.

For example:

- If you want to opt-out of tracking, execute the install script with
  `--do-not-track`.
- If you want to use the white-labeled version, execute the install script with
  `--white-labeled`.

<Warning>
Some configurations are not preserved if you would like to change them on an already configured instance.

These options are the following: `--white-labeled`, `--do-no-track`, `--white-labeled-icon`.

So if you installed Coolify with `--do-no-track` before, and you want to also use `--white-labeled` option, you need execute the install script with `--do-not-track` and `--white-labeled`!
</Warning>

## Restart

If for some reason, your instance crashes, you can restart it with the following command:

```bash
wget -q https://get.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh \
-O install.sh; sudo bash ./install.sh -r
```

## Uninstall

You can easily uninstall Coolify by stopping the following containers,
`coolify`, `coolify-proxy` and `coolify-fluentbit`, or execute the following
script:

```bash
docker stop -t 0 coolify coolify-proxy coolify-fluentbit; docker rm coolify coolify-proxy coolify-fluentbit
```

You also need to cleanup all the docker volumes as well.

```bash
docker volume rm coolify-db coolify-letsencrypt coolify-local-backup coolify-logs coolify-ssl-certs coolify-traefik-letsencrypt
```

And delete all configurations in `~/coolify`:

```bash
rm -f ~/coolify
```
