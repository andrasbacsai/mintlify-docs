[Coolify](https://coolify.io) is a self-hostable, all-in-one solution to host your applications, databases, or other open-source services with a few simple clicks.

It's an alternative software to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and other alternatives out there.


## Features
- Deploy `Static, NodeJS, Svelte, React, Vue, Next, Nuxt, Astro, PHP, Rust, and more` applications hassle-free with automatic reverse proxy and free SSL certificates.
- One-click `MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, CouchDB, RedisDB` instances ready to use, locally or over the internet.
- One-click and deploy your own instance of `WordPress, Ghost, Plausible Analytics, NocoDB, BitWarden/VaultWarden, LanguageTool, N8n, VSCode Server, and more`.
- Deploy any of these resources to a `Local Docker Engine` or `Remote Docker Engine`.
- Integration with `GitHub`, `GitLab`, `hosted` or `self-hosted versions`.
- `Automagically deploy new commits` and `pull requests` separately to quickly review contributions and speed up your teamwork!
- You can manage teams easily with our `new team management system`. Each team is separated by a namespace, and you can create as many teams as you want.
- Upgrade your all-in-one IaaS platform with one button!
