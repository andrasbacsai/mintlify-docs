## Git Sources

Git Sources defines where to fetch/pull your application code.

These sources are used to:

- Setup helper apps (such as GitHub App, GitLab App) at your Git providers.
- Provides access through tokens/ssh keys to your repositories.
- Clone your application's code.
- Set up webhooks for automated deployments.

## Supported Git Sources

- GitHub
- GitLab

You can use self-hosted or enterprise version of these Git providers as well.

## How to Integrate with Gitlab

1. (in Coolify) If you haven't already, in **Settings**, specify a URL (FQDN) like `coolify.yourdomain.com`. This is not required, but it makes the setup easier.
2. Once that's complete, close the page, navigate to `coolify.yourdomain.com`, and log back in.
3. (in Coolify) In `Git Sources`, add a new GitLab source.
4. In a new browser tab, navigate to your GitLab instance and find the UI to add a new application.
5. (in GitLab) Enter the `Callback URL` as `https://coolify.yourdomain.com/webhooks/gitlab`.
6. (in GitLab) check the following scopes: `api`, `read_repository`, `email`.
7. (in GitLab) Save the application and copy the `Application ID` .
8. (in Coolify) In your new source, paste the `Application ID`.
9. (in GitLab) In the newly created application, copy the `Secret`.
10. (in Coolify) Paste the `Secret`.
11. (in Coolify) Enter the OAuth ID. It will be the located at the end of the url of your GitLab application: `https://yourgitlabdomain.com/oauth/applications/123456`.
12. (in Coolify) Hit save.
13. (in Coolify) In `Applications` add a new application with GitLab as the source.
14. If you're still logged into GitLab, an authorization popup will appear. Click authorize.
